           <b> Bhagat Singh</b> was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then 
            British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh
            Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization
            Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915.  He was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior
            British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the 
            Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into 
            a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism 
            and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's 
            nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.
